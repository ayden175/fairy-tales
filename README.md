# Fairy Tale Corpus

This repository is part of the course "Understanding Language with Computers" from group 冰激凌.



## Structure

Each folder contains several textfiles, which each contain one fairy tale. The name of the folder corresponds to the author or the generator that was used. The filename corresponds to the name of the fairy tale.



## Sources

The non-generated fairy tales are taken from [World of Tales](https://www.worldoftales.com/fairy_tales.html#gsc.tab=0). 

The generated fairy tales were generated with TODO.
